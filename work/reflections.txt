Assignment 1

•    Did you before knowing about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?
I did have some previous experiences with git and GitHub but not markdown or GitHub pages. 
Because we have had programming related projects at previous courses, we have used git as revision control. 
In previous projects we worked mostly with push, pull, merge, branch, commit and in some cases merge conflicts, 
revert and reset. Of course, there are many practices that I still need and want to learn about revision control. 

•    Have you ever created websites before?
Yes, I had a similar course in the senior high school (gymnasium), if I recall it was called “Webbutveckling”,
 which included HTML and CSS. We did some PHP as well, but I have forgotten most of it. When I created my websites,
  I did not use any js which I am excited to work with.

•    Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.
My previous experience with web development is that I enjoy it a lot however I did not work with very complex implementations,
 simpler HTML and CSS. I remember enjoying the designing aspect of it. We did not work too much with the backend side.

•    What is your TIL for this course section?
•        Tagging the version of the commit.
•        Git hub pages, I learned that it is possible to host your website on GitHub
•        Live server extension on visual studio to be able to visually see your changes as you work.
•        Being able to create other upstream and down streams 


Assignment 2

• Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?
Yes, as I mentioned before I have some previous knowledge about HTML and CSS but only a very little amount about JavaScript. I am, however, very interested in learning more about
JavaScript since I have always been interested in designing and creating neat interfaces. Something that I did not learn about HTML and CSS is what the best practices are, which I think is very important.

• Explain the role of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in web development.
Hypertext Markup Language is a standard used to display documents on web browsers. The web browsers download the HTML documents from the internet to render them and display them to the user.
The amount of visual customization on an HTML document is limited, it is possible to add images and such. CSS was invented to add some customization options to HTML documents, like fonts, colors, and backgrounds. 
JavaScript makes it possible for webpages to become interactive, used for example in games or image editing.

• Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol, and the web server interacts.
The browser uses HTTP to send almost all kinds of files over the internet. The communication between the browser and a server starts with a contact initialization from the client-side.
The client sends an HTTP request to the server and based on the request and possibly some data, the server sends a response. The server can not start to communicate with a client.

• What is your TIL for this course section?
•        I learned how the version number is used to show what has been changed in an update. 
•        A little about common practices using git.
•        jQuery can be used to insert HTML documents in a div.


Assignment 3

• Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?
I have tested JavaScript briefly when working with React, however, this was only for a few hours so not enough to get any real understanding of how to properly use the language.

• Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?
The only language that I have a wide understanding in is Java so I would compare it to that. Both Java and JavaScript can be used in similar ways, they both have functions, variables, loops, if statements, etcetera. 
Writing JS feels very natural after using Java, I would say that JS is a bit liberal, which is both good and bad. This because it can be easy to create bugs when the language is not that strict.

• Describe how you worked with the coding exercise:
I used mostly google searching in order to find solutions to the problems I encountered, for example when I wanted to create animations. 
I feel like the exercise wasn't that difficult but it was very time consuming. The time it took could be the result of me putting too much attention into the details. 
Another thing that took some time was figuring out which way to tackle different issues, since there is multiple solutions for every problem.

• What grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?
I aim for a 5 and I feel pretty happy with how it turned out. 
I definitely feel like I could refactor the code in order to make it more readable and there is definitely some pieces of spaghetti code.

• What is your TIL for this course section?

  • I learned about inserting php/html files in a php document
  • creating animations using CSS transition and Keyframe as well as jQuery Animate
  • the meaning of different CSS properties 
  • how to fetch and handle a json
  • how async funtions work and how they are implemented

Assignment 4

  Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.
How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?
Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?
What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?
What is your TIL for this course section?
Ensure you have pushed all your work to GitHub and attach a tag v4.0.0 or greater.
