Lecture 1

•	Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?
I did have some previous experiences with git and GitHub but not markdown or GitHub pages. 
Because we have had programming related projects at previous courses, we have used git as revision control. 
In previous projects we worked mostly with push, pull, merge, branch, commit and in some cases merge conflicts, 
revert and reset. Of course, there is many practices that I still need and want to learn about revision control. 

•	Have you ever created websites before?
Yes, I had a similar course in the senior high school (gymnasium), if I recall it was called “Webbutveckling”,
 which included html and css. We did some php as well, but I have forgotten most of it. When I created my websites,
  I did not use any js which I am excited to work with.

•	Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.
My previous experience with web development is that I enjoy it a lot however I did not work with very complex implementations,
 simpler html and css. I remember really enjoying the designing aspect of it. We did not work too much with the backend side.

•	What is your TIL for this course section?
•	    Tagging the version of the commit.
•	    Git hub pages, I learned that it is possible to host your website on github
•	    Live server extension on visual studio to be able to visually see your changes as you work.
•	    Being able to create other up streams and down streams
