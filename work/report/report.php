                        Assignment 1
                        <br><br>
                        • Did you before knowing about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?
                        I did have some previous experiences with git and GitHub but not markdown or GitHub pages.
                        Because we have had programming related projects at previous courses, we have used git as
                        revision control. In previous projects we worked mostly with push, pull, merge, branch, commit
                        and in some cases
                        merge conflicts, revert and reset. Of course, there are many practices that I still need and
                        want to learn about
                        revision control.
                        <br><br>
                        • Have you ever created websites before?
                        Yes, I had a similar course in the senior high school (gymnasium), if I recall it was called
                        “Webbutveckling”,
                        which included HTML and CSS. We did some PHP as well, but I have forgotten most of it. When I
                        created my websites, I did not use any js which I am excited to work with.
                        <br><br>
                        • Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.
                        My previous experience with web development is that I enjoy it a lot however I did not work with
                        very complex implementations, simpler HTML and CSS. I remember enjoying the designing aspect of
                        it. We did not work too much with the backend side.

                        • Live server extension on visual studio to be able to visually see your changes as you
                        work.<br>

                        Assignment 2
                        <br><br>
                        • Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?
                        Yes, as I mentioned before I have some previous knowledge about HTML and CSS but only a very
                        little amount about JavaScript. I am, however, very interested in learning more about
                        JavaScript since I have always been interested in designing and creating neat interfaces.
                        Something that I did not learn about HTML and CSS is what the best practices are, which I think
                        is very
                        important.
                        <br><br>
                        • Explain the role of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in web development.
                        Hypertext Markup Language is a standard used to display documents on web browsers. The web
                        browsers download the HTML documents from the internet to render them and display them to the
                        user.
                        The amount of visual customization on an HTML document is limited, it is possible to add images
                        and such. CSS was invented to add some customization options to HTML documents, like fonts,
                        colors,
                        and backgrounds. JavaScript makes it possible for webpages to become interactive, used for
                        example in games or image editing.
                        <br><br>
                        • Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol, and the webserver interacts.
                        The browser uses HTTP to send almost all kinds of files over the internet. The communication
                        between the browser and a server starts with a contact initialization from the client-side.
                        The client sends an HTTP request to the server and based on the request and possibly some data,
                        the server sends a response. The server can not start to communicate with a client.

                        Assignment 3
                        <br><br>
                        • Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?
                        I have tested JavaScript briefly when working with React, however, this was only for a few hours
                        so not enough to get any real understanding of how to properly use the language.
                        <br><br>
                        • Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?
                        The only language that I have a wide understanding in is Java so I would compare it to that.
                        Both Java and JavaScript can be used in similar ways, they both have functions, variables,
                        loops, if statements, etcetera.
                        Writing JS feels very natural after using Java, I would say that JS is a bit liberal, which is
                        both good and bad. This because it can be easy to create bugs when the language is not that
                        strict.
                        <br><br>
                        • Describe how you worked with the coding exercise:
                        I used mostly google searching in order to find solutions to the problems I encountered, for
                        example when I wanted to create animations.
                        I feel like the exercise was not that difficult but it was very time consuming. The time it took
                        could be the result of me putting too much attention into the details.
                        Another thing that took some time was figuring out which way to tackle different issues, since
                        there is multiple solutions for every problem.
                        <br><br>
                        • What grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?
                        I aim for a 5 and I feel pretty happy with how it turned out.
                        I definitely feel like I could refactor the code in order to make it more readable and there is
                        definitely some pieces of spaghetti code.

                        <br><br>
                        • Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.<br>
                        I had no previous knowledge about node or npm before this assignment. I have only heard about
                        node.js before and understood that it was relented to backend.
                        <br><br>
                        • How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?<br>
                        I enjoy it, it was not so long ago since we worked with RESTful api´s so express and node was
                        pretty straight foreword.
                        When it comes to js I feel like I've really improved and gathered an understanding surrounding
                        it during the previous assignment.
                        Ejs was a bit different and tricky to use with all the <% %> but doable with some logic.
                    <br><br>
                    • Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?<br>
                    This time I decided to follow the instructions thoroughly and use the tools and resources that where provided to us. 
                    I worked very efficiently and did not spend as much time debugging as with the previous assignment, even if the result is not as impressive.
                    <br><br>
                    • What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?<br>
                    Grade 5, it was not too difficult, I managed to complete the assignment in a somewhat short amount of time.

                    <br><br>
                    • How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?<br>
                    I have note worked too much with it but so far I like it. It feels a little tricky to work in by itself since it feels like combining html and php, I feel like it could be easier 
                    to work with html and php separately, maybe that what we are supposed to do and I am just doing it wrong.
                    <br><br>
                    • Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?<br>
                    I would say it is kinda like java and html combined. I do not have too much experience but I feel like it is very similar to html (since you can write html in it). 
                    <br><br>
                    • Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?<br>
                    I followed the assignment until grade 5, which is the grade I am aiming for. I would say that I am satisfied with the result but the code feels a bit unpolished. 
                    I also found the examples very helpful, I did try to do something different from the examples bu was unsure if that would be bad practice so decided to go with what was recommended to us.
                     The way I wanted to solve it was similar to the MVC method, instead of having the needed mysql methods in the php files, I wanted to have one mysql file that handled all communication with the db and 
                     then different views that was talking to controllers that was talking to the mysql.php.

                        <br><br>
                    • What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages?<br>
                    My first thoughts of the most popular programming language, which according to https://insights.stackoverflow.com/ (2019) is JavaScript, is that it makes sense. 
                    Almost all modern companies today has some kind of website which creates a huge demand of JavaScript amongst others (HTML/CSS which is on close second).
                    One interesting thought, however, is to think about if the web dev jobs ever will be replaced with some kind of WordPress or similar
                    <br><br>
                    • What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?<br>
                    Of course I would like something that is high in demand to get better opportunities but also a language related to something I really enjoy, there are some areas where 
                    I would love to work with the knowledge I have today, like IOT, robotics, web design or innovation. Unfortunately I do not have enough experience with any of the areas to be certain.
                    But I would believe that my future job would be something with JavaScript, Java, C or python.
                    <br><br>
                    • Do your own investigation on https://trends.google.com (Links to an external site.) to customize your own comparison on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results.<br><br>
                    I decided to compare some languages and was actually surprized by the result.
                     So I compared Java, Flutter, React.js, JavaScript and Python. And to my surprize python was the most searched, could this be because it also is a snake, perhaps. 
                     The second most searched was Java followed by JavaScript, React.js and lastly Flutter, which I also thought was a bit strange since Flutter is developed by Google which would provide with some recognition. 
                     That Java is close second makes sense to me, since it has so many usability's.
                     <br><br>
                    • If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?<br>
                    It all would depend on what area of work but since it is probably web based or phone based I would recommend react.js or react native, simply because a lot of companies are using it, 
                    it is pretty modern but still well tested and its multiplatform which would give more bang for the buck.
                    <br><br>
                    • What is your TIL for this course section?<br>
                    • that python is 20x more searched than Flutter
                    • more reflective thinking than any concrete learning outcomes.

                    • Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft technology.<br>
                    ASP.NET is a framework used to develop dynamic web applications. It uses module view controllers and can be used to develop web pages, restful api's amongst other things. 
                    One key feature with ASP.NET is that it is possible to write C# code directly inside html content which can be used to create dynamic web sites. 
                    <br><br>
                    • Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the course.<br>
                    I would compare it to php, in the sense that both are used for back end. It seems like both php and asp.net can accomplish similar tasks even if asp.net only is a framework.
                    The differences however, seem to be that php is more focused on server side while asp is more general web applications. Secondly ASP seems to be both faster and secure than php, even if This
                    is up the the programmer to decide while implementing.<br><br>
                    • Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?<br>
                    First I decided to read up on ASP.NET from windows learning website, just to get a more general understanding and once I felt that I was ready I continued with the assignment. 
                    I felt that the youtube videos from the lectures also was useful to get starting. I aimed for a 5 but since I was out a little in last minute I only accomplished 4 (because you only need 3 x grade 5's to get a final grade 5).
                    I am pretty happy with the outcome thought.<br><br>

                    In General the 3 websites performed well. They would load fast and all of them would have a time between 1-2 seconds for finishing loading the website with all content showing.
                    Although when we analysed the websites using Light house ikea and sigma still did fine but suddenly Tetra pak looked grim. In accessibility and best practices they performed
                    poorly compared to the other websites. For accessibility their The form labels did not have associated labels and buttons does not have accessible names. for best practices they
                    still have 3 resources that they get through http 1.1 and not 2. They include front-end Javascript libraries with known security vulnerabilities and browser errors are logged
                    to the console.

                    • Elaborate on a few (3-5) different security issues or concerns, from your own experience, related to web application security and relate them to the OWASP top ten.<br>
                    Before phishing techniques was well known I once phished my friends facebook username and password.
                     This was done by copying the error page by facebook when trying to enter a facebook page but not logged in, then changing a method in the login-form so the data was saved in a database. 
                    This was only jokes and fun and my friend did not mind but if the wrong person got the credentials it could have ended badly. I would say that this scenario would fall under "A2-Broken Authentication", 
                    and could have been prevented by various ways, many of which are in use today.<br><br>
                    Another scenario, also with broken authentication, is when I have closed a tab on which i have been logged to some website and left my computer.
                     Then my friend shows up, opens the website where the session ID is available and now has access to my account.<br><br>
                    If we look at another vulnerability, A1-Injection, was once preformed when I was testing a console app (with a mySQL connection), I created for another course.<br><br>
                    • Summarize by providing your own guidelines to a new web programmer on the topic “The essential guidelines to follow to create secure web applications”.<br>
                    First and foremost, use HTTPS, it solves some common security issues like man in the middle attacks.<br>
                    If using mySQL, use sql queries. <br>
                    Decouple the website, parts where it does not make sense to communicate, should not communicate. this way if a hacker gets access to one part of the website, then he can still not get to another <br>
                    Use logging, then you can see suspicious behavior. <br>
                    Make sure that there is a way to contact you if someone finds a security flaw.<br><br>
