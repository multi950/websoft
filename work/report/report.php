                        Assignment 1
                        <br><br>
                        • Did you before knowing about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?
                        I did have some previous experiences with git and GitHub but not markdown or GitHub pages.
                        Because we have had programming related projects at previous courses, we have used git as
                        revision control. In previous projects we worked mostly with push, pull, merge, branch, commit
                        and in some cases
                        merge conflicts, revert and reset. Of course, there are many practices that I still need and
                        want to learn about
                        revision control.
                        <br><br>
                        • Have you ever created websites before?
                        Yes, I had a similar course in the senior high school (gymnasium), if I recall it was called
                        “Webbutveckling”,
                        which included HTML and CSS. We did some PHP as well, but I have forgotten most of it. When I
                        created my websites, I did not use any js which I am excited to work with.
                        <br><br>
                        • Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.
                        My previous experience with web development is that I enjoy it a lot however I did not work with
                        very complex implementations, simpler HTML and CSS. I remember enjoying the designing aspect of
                        it. We did not work too much with the backend side.

                        • Git hub pages, I learned that it is possible to host your website on GitHub<br>
                        • Live server extension on visual studio to be able to visually see your changes as you
                        work.<br>
                        • Being able to create other upstream and down streams<br>

                        Assignment 2
                        <br><br>
                        • Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?
                        Yes, as I mentioned before I have some previous knowledge about HTML and CSS but only a very
                        little amount about JavaScript. I am, however, very interested in learning more about
                        JavaScript since I have always been interested in designing and creating neat interfaces.
                        Something that I did not learn about HTML and CSS is what the best practices are, which I think
                        is very
                        important.
                        <br><br>
                        • Explain the role of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in web development.
                        Hypertext Markup Language is a standard used to display documents on web browsers. The web
                        browsers download the HTML documents from the internet to render them and display them to the
                        user.
                        The amount of visual customization on an HTML document is limited, it is possible to add images
                        and such. CSS was invented to add some customization options to HTML documents, like fonts,
                        colors,
                        and backgrounds. JavaScript makes it possible for webpages to become interactive, used for
                        example in games or image editing.
                        <br><br>
                        • Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol, and the webserver interacts.
                        The browser uses HTTP to send almost all kinds of files over the internet. The communication
                        between the browser and a server starts with a contact initialization from the client-side.
                        The client sends an HTTP request to the server and based on the request and possibly some data,
                        the server sends a response. The server can not start to communicate with a client.

                        • What is your TIL for this course section?<br>
                        • I learned how the version number is used to show what has been changed in an update.<br>
                        • A little about common practices using git.<br>
                        • jQuery can be used to insert HTML documents in a div.<br></p>

                        Assignment 3
                        <br><br>
                        • Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?
                        I have tested JavaScript briefly when working with React, however, this was only for a few hours
                        so not enough to get any real understanding of how to properly use the language.
                        <br><br>
                        • Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?
                        The only language that I have a wide understanding in is Java so I would compare it to that.
                        Both Java and JavaScript can be used in similar ways, they both have functions, variables,
                        loops, if statements, etcetera.
                        Writing JS feels very natural after using Java, I would say that JS is a bit liberal, which is
                        both good and bad. This because it can be easy to create bugs when the language is not that
                        strict.
                        <br><br>
                        • Describe how you worked with the coding exercise:
                        I used mostly google searching in order to find solutions to the problems I encountered, for
                        example when I wanted to create animations.
                        I feel like the exercise was not that difficult but it was very time consuming. The time it took
                        could be the result of me putting too much attention into the details.
                        Another thing that took some time was figuring out which way to tackle different issues, since
                        there is multiple solutions for every problem.
                        <br><br>
                        • What grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?
                        I aim for a 5 and I feel pretty happy with how it turned out.
                        I definitely feel like I could refactor the code in order to make it more readable and there is
                        definitely some pieces of spaghetti code.

                    Assignment 4
                    <br><br>
                    • Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.<br>
                    I had no previous knowledge about node or npm before this assignment. I have only heard about 
                    node.js before and understood that it was relented to backend.
                    <br><br>
                    • How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?<br>
                    I enjoy it, it was not so long ago since we worked with RESTful api´s so express and node was pretty straight foreword. 
                    When it comes to js I feel like I've really improved and gathered an understanding surrounding it during the previous assignment. 
                    Ejs was a bit different and tricky to use with all the <% %> but doable with some logic.
                    <br><br>
                    • Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?<br>
                    This time I decided to follow the instructions thoroughly and use the tools and resources that where provided to us. 
                    I worked very efficiently and did not spend as much time debugging as with the previous assignment, even if the result is not as impressive.
                    <br><br>
                    • What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?<br>
                    Grade 5, it was not too difficult, I managed to complete the assignment in a somewhat short amount of time. 
                    <br><br>

                    <p>Assignment 5
                    <br><br>
                    • How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?<br>
                    I have note worked too much with it but so far I like it. It feels a little tricky to work in by itself since it feels like combining html and php, I feel like it could be easier 
                    to work with html and php separately, maybe that what we are supposed to do and I am just doing it wrong.
                    <br><br>
                    • Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?<br>
                    I would say it is kinda like java and html combined. I do not have too much experience but I feel like it is very similar to html (since you can write html in it). 
                    <br><br>
                    • Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?<br>
                    I followed the assignment until grade 5, which is the grade I am aiming for. I would say that I am satisfied with the result but the code feels a bit unpolished. 
                    I also found the examples very helpful, I did try to do something different from the examples bu was unsure if that would be bad practice so decided to go with what was recommended to us.
                     The way I wanted to solve it was similar to the MVC method, instead of having the needed mysql methods in the php files, I wanted to have one mysql file that handled all communication with the db and 
                     then different views that was talking to controllers that was talking to the mysql.php.
